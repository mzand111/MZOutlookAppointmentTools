# MZOutlookAppointmentTools.iCalendarTools

Outlook has been a widely used email client for over a decade, and it supports recurring appointments and events. However, developers have always faced challenges using standard iCalendar [recurrence rule strings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.8.5.3) with the Outlook Interop library when developing add-ins or other code that interacts with this functionality.
This package contains simple codes to 
	1. Create a `RecurrencePattern` for an `AppointmentItem`, getting a recurrence rule string 
	2. Generate equivalent recurrence rule string from a `RecurrencePattern`
